# 🧪 CloudNova Task Management API

A simple yet well-structured **Task Management REST API** built using **Spring Boot**. This lab project is designed to demonstrate the use of Spring's **IoC (Inversion of Control)**, **Dependency Injection**, and **Spring MVC** for building RESTful services. The application is also **containerized using Docker** for consistent deployment.
